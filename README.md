 A lex.yy.c file which got greated after compiling the code.        
 A scanner file                                          
 A test files folder which contains the example file to run and check output.                                                       



## Deployment

To deploy Assigment 2 

Method 1:
Click on the replit link : https://replit.com/@yash09upadhyay/Discrete-maths#main.c

Method 2:   
Open replit and after creating a account create a new repl.
Choose the language as C and name the reply.
